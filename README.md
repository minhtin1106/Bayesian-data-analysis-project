# Computers dataset- The effects of specs on computer prices- Bayesian inference


__Introduction__:<br>
As a student, we often live on a rather tight budget. However, there are times when we have to make some huge purchases. That is still possible if we could have with us a decent savings plan. In order to start putting some money aside, answer the question: How much should I put aside per time? How much does the product I want to buy cost?<br>
To help students to have an estimate of the price for the next laptop they would like to buy so that they could start to sketch a suitable savings plan from now, I decided to work on this project

__Scope__>:<br>
the data is the specifications and price of computers collected from computer magazines in the period of 1993-1995

__Tasks__:<br>
+ Provided sensible reasoning for model choices: hierarchical model vs pooled model;  distribution of the prior and that that for the sampling model
+ Evaluated the model performance by investigating the posterior predictive check, and by conducting predictive accuracy assessment 
+ Compared hierarchical model and pooled model 

__Results__:<br> 
I worked out the winning model is the hierarchical model and given that model, I could gain the insight that hard drive has the strongest effect on the price which is interesting. So, next time when we want to estimate how much our next computer costs us, we could tell by knowing how many hard drive we need for the computer.
