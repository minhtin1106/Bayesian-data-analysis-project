# COMPUTERS DATASET-THE EFFECTS OF SPECS ON COMPUTER PRICES- BAYESIAN INFERENCE

The dataset is about computer prices, and relevant specs: hard drive, RAM, screen, CD-ROM, manufacturer, etc

In this project, I applied Bayesian inference workflow to answer these questions:
+ could we make use of the information of components of the computers to have an estimate of their prices?
+ which component has strong effects on prices than others have?
+ are these effects over time?


Steps included: 
+Building model: hierarchical model vs pooled model; setting the likelihood model,  prior choices in the case of multiple covariates
+Writing STAN code to do MCMC simulation
+Checking model: posterior predictive check
+Comparing model: ELPD

For more details, I highly recommend that you could allocate some time to read through the whole report.

You could also see my presentation for this project. It is more stunning and vivid I would say.
